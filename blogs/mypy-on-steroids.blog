<p>
<a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Mypy</a> is a nifty static type checker for Python
that will help you nip nasty production bugs in the bud. Especially when you're already in the habit of generously
using type hints in your code.
Head over to <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html">their docs</a> to get started if
you're not using Mypy already.
</p>

Mypy <em>is</em> kind of slow though. On a code base of 200 Python files it already takes 2 seconds to
check the code. Luckily there's a quick fix! You can run Mypy in daemon mode, and it will (partially) cache previous
run results and be up to 20 times faster ðŸš€
</p>

To speed things up, just change the Mypy command from `mypy &lt;arguments> &lt;file(s)>` like this:

```
mypy --check-untyped-defs hello_world.py
```

To `dmypy -- &lt;arguments> &lt;file(s)>` like this:

```
dmypy -- --check-untyped-defs hello_world.py
```

The first time you run the command in daemon mode, it will still be slow as it needs to generate the cached data.
Subsequent calls will be much faster though. For the ~200 file code base down from 2 seconds to 0.1.
