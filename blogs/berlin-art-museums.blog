Berlin is full of art, artists and art museums. Below I listed the places
I visited and can really recommend. If you plan to visit lots of museums 
<a href="https://www.smb.museum/en/plan-your-visit/annual-tickets.html">
an annual ticket</a> (available and valid in many of the bigger museums)
 or <a href="https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-welcome-card">the Berlin 
welcome card</a>, which includes public transport, may be interesting for 
you.
