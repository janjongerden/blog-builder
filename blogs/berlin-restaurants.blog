<h1>Restaurants in Berlin</h1>

<p>
Restaurants in Berlin are affordable, ubiquitous, tasty, and very divers. Where most of Germany
sticks to schnitzels and greasy sausages with sauerkraut, Berlin caters to any taste and is
remarkably vegan and vegetarian friendly.
<p>
In most restaurants your meal won't cost you more than 10 euros, and portions are generous. For
good lunch deals, try weekdays around office spaces, as the Berliners tend to have a warm meal for
lunch, usually in a restaurant next to their workplace, with some colleagues. These deals cost
around 5 to 8 euros, and tend to include soup, main dish, some salad or a softdrink.
<p>
Below I list my personal favorites. Note that this list reflects the state of affairs
in 2019, so you may want to double-check if these places still exist. As anywhere in Berlin: bring
 cash, as cards are frowned upon in most places.

<h5>Mustafa's Gemüse Kebap</h5>
Let's start with the weirdest food attraction:
<a href="http://www.mustafas.de/">Mustafa's Gemüse Kebap</a>.
Their pitas are truly wonderful, but if you want to get one, be prepared to either go on a rainy
weekday at 3 at night, or stand in line for at least an hour. The line is so extreme, that many
people first buy a curry wurst at the Curry 36 at the corner to prevent starvation during the wait.
The kebap itself is not vegetarian, the name comes from the grilled vegetables they add. Still,
the vegetarian pita is also worth queueing for if you're not in a rush. Otherwise, just laugh at
the tourists in the queue and head on to one of the other Kreuzberg options below.
<br/>
This tiny food stall apparently rose to fame when they went live with an outrageous flash-website.
Unfortunately, no modern browser supports flash anymore, so while still online, the site is lost in time.

<h5>King King</h5>
The best sushi in town is served by
<a href="https://www.kingkingberlin.de/">King King</a>, a sushi bar just off of Alexander Platz.
All their sushi is delicious, but my all-time favourites must be either Sushi Menü 2 or 4, which
both look <em>and</em> taste much better than they sound.
Though spacious, the place quickly fills up in the evenings, so make a reservation to
ensure a place at the table.

<h5>Phantasia</h5>
<a href="https://www.phantasiarestaurant.de/">Phantasia</a> is a laid-back
Asian restaurant with a varied menu and friendly staff. The pho or any
of the noodle dishes are especially worthwhile. Besides the food, it's famous for being
the home base of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DutchSocaLovers/">
Dutch Soca Lovers</a> during the <a href="https://www.karneval.berlin/">Karneval der Kulturen</a>.

<h5>Mela</h5>
For great Indian food, <a href="https://restaurant-mela.de/">Mela</a> is the place to be.
All their dishes meet standards normally only met in India, but if you need a tip, try their
vegetable thali (warning: rather large portion). An extra bonus is their nice outdoor seating
on a quiet street.

<h5>Little Tibet</h5>
Visit <a href="https://cdn.website.dish.co/media/57/88/4169851/Lil-Tibet-Menu-2022.pdf">Little Tibet</a>
for a tibetan bite. The momos and the norbu tse are some top dishes here. Enjoy your meal under
the watching eye of a life-size Dalai Lama, while sipping on a Warsteiner.

<h5>Knofi</h5>
With a large Turkish community, it is easy to find Turkish food anywhere in Berlin.
One of the finest places is <a href="http://knofi.de/">Knofi</a>, suitable for breakfast, lunch
and dinner. Their plates offer a variety of Turkish specialties, the soups are lovely, and they have a selection
of sweetness to top it off. Popular in the weekends and evenings, so watch your timing or make a reservation.

<h5>Meze Haus</h5>
Another Turkish recommendation is the Meze Haus (no known website) on the other side of Kreuzberg in the
Oranienstraße.
Formerly a branch of Knofi, they now sport their own menu, where you can pick your own selection of
feta-spreads and salads from their glass display. The welcoming staff may call you "Liebling" out of the
blue, so be prepared!

<h5>Soy</h5>
The vegan Vietnamese restaurant <a href="https://www.soy-berlin.com/#menu">Soy</a> next to the Volksbühne
is another favorite of mine. All dishes are great, as is their lunchdeal (weekdays only).
Don't forget to hop over to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Volksbar/@52.526647,13.4085176,17z/">Volksbar</a>
across the street for a drink afterwards.
Unless it's Sunday evening, when that bar is full of zombie-like Germans watching Tatort on a big screen.

<h5>Alaska</h5>
The best tapas restaurant east of Spain is Alaska (no known website). The whole menu is vegan, yet
indistinguishable from the original Spanish delicacies, as attested by a Catalan colleague of mine.
Besides food, their wine menu is also exceptional, as are their occasional grunge karaoke nights.
The place is tiny, so call ahead to claim your seat.

<br/>
<br/>

<h5>Dada Falafel</h5>
The center of falafel culture must be Dada Falafel (no known website), where pitas or plates of
the best falafel known to mankind are distributed among tourists and locals alike.
I also wanted to recommended <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cp2vTYE7yhvZw9VM8">this hole in the wall
in Neukölln</a>, where a grumpy old Balkan lady was serving the best falafel you ever tasted, while trying
to sell you some of her homemade liquor on side. Unfortunately she seems to have closed shop.
<br/>
<strong>🍴</strong> Middle Eastern
<strong>📍</strong> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/E5H6Q4uzHGWKCCKV9">location</a>
<strong>🏙</strong> Mitte

<br/>
<br/>

<h5>Babel</h5>
At <a href="https://babel-restaurant.com/">Babel</a>, you will find a mix of middle eastern dishes.
If you are in a hungry mood, try the (vegetarian) "Babel Platte" for two. Otherwise, you'd better
settle for a smaller dish such as a haloumi sandwich. While in the neighbourhood, why not visit the
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WaajQLdjWrRj1v8S7">David Hasselhoff Museum</a> down the road as well.
