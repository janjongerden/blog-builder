description=How to set the time on an Ariete coffee machine.
--content

The Ariete coffee maker makes great coffee, but setting the time is not for the faint of heart.
Every time I unplug it, the time needs to be reset as it has no backup battery. And every time I struggle.
So here's the definitive setting-the-time-on-an-Ariete guide.

<h2>Setting the time</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Press the left-most, <strong>mode</strong> button several times, until a clock-like icon appears.
        The text says 'timer', but what it really does is set the <em>time</em>.
        As the display blinks a lot while switching modes, you sometimes have to wait a second before the active icon shows.
    </li>
    <li>
        Press the <strong>sel</strong> button once (second button from the left).
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the time using the <strong>hr</strong> and <strong>min</strong> buttons.
    </li>
    <li>
        Press <strong>sel</strong> once more to confirm the time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Voil√†! The time is once again set.
    </li>
</ol>
