<h1>changing the alt-tab behaviour in Ubuntu</h1>

In recent Ubuntu version, application switching using alt-tab by
default groups all windows of the same type together, instead of cycling
through the individual windows. This makes no sense!
<br/>
<br/>
To fix the default behaviour you will need to install the compiz settings 
manager and some additional plugins:

<pre><code>$ sudo apt install compizconfig-settings-manager
$ sudo apt install compiz-plugins
$ sudo apt install compiz-plugins-extra
</code></pre>

Now start the settings manager either from the menu or the command line:

<pre><code>$ ccsm
</code></pre>

In the settings manager go to <b>Desktop->Ubuntu Unity Plugin</b> and open the 
<b>Switcher</b> tab. Here, disable the top two keys: 
"Key to start the Switcher"
and "Key to switch to the previous window in the Switcher" by clicking on
their short-cut button and unchecking the enabled checkbox. This disables the
default window switching behaviour.

<br />
<br />

Now go back to the main window and go to <b>Window Management</b>. Check the 
<b>Static Application Switcher</b> checkbox. This may cause a pop-up to appear
 that
warns you about conflicting key bindings, you can ignore this pop-up and go to
the settings of the Static Application Switcher by clicking on it. Here set 
the keyboard short-cuts for previous/next window to alt-tab and alt-shift-tab.
Alternatively you can bind these short cuts to Next/Prev window (All windows)
to also cycle through windows from other workspaces. The alt-tabbing will now 
look like this:
<br />
<br />
<img src="img/static-switcher.png" alt="static switcher in action"/>
<br />
<br />
That's it, you can now enjoy sane alt-tabbing again!
