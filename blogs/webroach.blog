One of my all-time favorite linux/unix applications is 'xroach', which lets a flock of cockroaches
run around on your desktop, until they find a window to hide behind.
It fits in a bigger suite of playful 90ties linux tools, such as xeyes, xsnow, xbill, and the likes.

Once standard in every linux install, xroach has slowly disappeared from distros over the
years. On the internet, some traces can be found, such as <a href="https://github.com/interkosmos/xroach">
this modernized version</a> by a fellow enthusiast.

<h3>moving to the web</h3>

I decided it was time to bring back xroach, but this time for the web. Using the original cockroach images,
my limited Javascript skills and some hacking, I came up with webroach:

It is <a href="https://github.com/janjongerden/webroach/blob/main/roaches.js">a single Javascript file</a>, which you
can add to your webpage to let roaches run around until they find a place to hide. You can activate the roaches by
including these lines in the <code>&lt;head></code> section of your html:

<pre><code class="prettyprint">
&lt;script src="roaches.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;script>
        window.onload = () => {
            roachesAreGo(10);
        };
    &lt;/script>
</code></pre>

This will get the roaches started, the argument of <code>roachesAreGo</code> is the initial number of roaches.
They'll hide behind images if they can find them, and will start moving again once the page scrolls up or down.
To demonstrate that effect, I added a bunch of slightly related images to this page.

<h3>technical implementation details</h3>

I was looking for a way to pack everything into a single file for easy of roachifying a webpage.
Here I discovered that it's possible to specify an html image in binary form! When you use
<strong>&lt;img src="data:image/png;base64,[the base64 encoded image data]></strong>, you can include
an image directly in your html or js. When the roaches move direction, they get assigned a new
image for that direction, by changing the src attribute.

<br/>
<br/>

Another thing I learned was how to detect if one html element is overlapping with another one.
The basic idea is to use the elements' <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code> properties and
check the coordinates. Additionally, I check the padding properties, as I noticed roaches
tended to hide in plain sight in the image padding.
