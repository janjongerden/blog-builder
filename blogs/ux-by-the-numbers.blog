<h1>UX by the numbers</h1>

I recently came across <a href="https://medium.com/@seandexter1/the-baymard-institute-a-glorious-evidence-based-trove-of-ux-best-practices-189d839b1176">
this insightful medium.com article</a>, pointing me to the UX research company <a href="https://baymard.com/">Baymard</a>.
They approach UX in a very scientific way and generously share many of their findings on their website. The 
<a href="https://baymard.com/ecommerce-design-examples">examples section</a> points at do's and don'ts using real life
examples and <a href="https://baymard.com/blog">their blog</a> has some nice long reads on specific topics.

<br/>
<br/>
One article I especially enjoyed was <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/drop-down-usability"> the one on dropdowns</a>, in
my experience an eternal source of usability issues, browser specific bugs and all other sorts of problems. 
Main take-aways here: don't use dropdowns at all when you have less than 5 or more than 10 items and try to use the
browser-native dropdowns unless you really need the additional styling freedom.

<br/>
<br/>
I really like their scientific approach to UX/UI, giving me some good rules of thumb to create better
user interfaces even without/before the input of a professional UX-er. In general this looks like a great way
to convince back and front enders that some designs are objectively better than others.
